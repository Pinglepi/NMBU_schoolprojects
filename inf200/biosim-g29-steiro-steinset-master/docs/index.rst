Welcome to the documentation for the biosim project, where we try to simulate a simple ecosystem on an island!

- Design an island and see it come to life
- Change the dynamics of the simulation by adjusting parameters
- See how the wildlife will handle volcanic winters
- Simulate branching simulations with the save and load functions
